- `stoic tool shell` where stdin is not connected to a TTY
- adb root, stoic tool shell, adb unroot, stoic tool shell (today it messes up permissions)
  - probably I need arsync-wrapper to check if its root and adjust permissions
    if so
- `stoic tool rsync`
  - especially when there is a file that's at least a few megabytes big since
    that can cause issues if --blocking-io is not passed
